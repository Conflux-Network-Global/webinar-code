# Conflux Sample DApp (Next.js)

This is the Next.js version of the sample DApp. You can bootstrap this using
`Create Next App` (see: [this section of the document](#learn-more))

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Check the console for info on how to preview it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React with Next in production mode and optimizes the build
for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
