# ShuttleFlow (Using Cross-Chain Assets)

### Files
`shuttleflowInfo` allows a user to query the shuttleflow endpoint to check what assets can be wrapped and their corresponding fees/contracts

`userInfo` allows a user to check which address to send assets to on ETH and the status of cross-chain transactions

`withdraw2eth` allows a user to burn cTokens on Conflux to send the wrapped asset back to themselves on ETH
